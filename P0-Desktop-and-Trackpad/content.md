Let's setup our desktop and some gestures on our trackpads.

# Hiding the Dock (Maximizing Screen Space)

You paid a lot for that computer, let's get the maximum space out of the screen. First we'll hide the dock.

> [action]
>
> 1. Use spotlight (`command`+`spacebar`) to search for and open your System Preferences
> 1. Click on "Dock".
> 1. Set the dock's position to the left/right/middle of the screen (your preference)
> 1. Set the dock to "Automatically hide and show the Dock".

> Instead of the dock, use Spotlight - `command`+`spacebar` to open applications more quickly

## More Maximizing Screen Space

Another trick to getting get even more space:

1. Return to system settings
1. Go into "Display"
1. Click on "Scaled"
1. Choose "More Space".

# Three Finger Drag

There is a hidden gesture in your mac that makes clicking and dragging, well, less of a drag :D. It's called the three finger drag. Here's how to set it up:

> [action]
>
> 1. In system preferences click on Accessibility.
> 1. Now click on Mouse & Trackpad.
> 1. Now on Trackpad Options
> 1. Now check "enable dragging" and set it to "three finger drag"
> 1. Now with three fingers touching your trackpad, try dragging a window or icon around

Boom! Three finger drag!

# Cheatsheet (Keyboard Shortcuts)
