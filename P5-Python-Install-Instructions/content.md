Everyone will be using Python for all your Computer Science courses, so we'll take this time to set the language up on your computer.

# Python Environment

Make sure you install the iOS environment first - the instructions assume you have, because you will need Command Line Tools and Homebrew installed already.

## Python 3

OS X comes with a version of Python (2.7) installed by default. We can call that the *system Python*. But that version is old! Python 3 was released in 2008, and it came with a bunch of syntax changes that were incompatible with 2.x versions of Python. This created a fork in the language, as many large Python projects (including many helpful libraries) didn't want to invest the time to convert to 3.x.  But that was then; it's now recommended that all new Python projects are made in Python 3.x. For more information, see [this article](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3).

So we're going to install the newest Python.

*These instructions are derived from [this great post](http://www.marinamele.com/2014/07/install-python3-on-mac-os-x-and-use-virtualenv-and-virtualenvwrapper.html)*.

Use Homebrew to install Python 3 and its dependencies:

	$ brew install python3

Once that's finished, you should be able to see which version of Python is installed like this:

	$ python3 --version

That will also install the Python package manager, called `pip`, which can be used to download Python libraries. Because we're using Python 3, you should always use `pip3`, which is the Python 3 version.

## Virtualenv

By default, `pip` and `pip3` install packages into a directory used by Python system-wide. This can create problems, because different Python projects might be dependent on different versions of libraries. Upgrading a library on one project might break all of your other projects, which is a nightmare.

`virtualenv` is the solution to this problem. Here's the [official documentation](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), but the TL;DR is that for each project it creates a virtual environment in which packages are installed, and ensures that the project is not dependent on any packages outside the virtual environment.

To install `virtualenv`, use the following command

	$ pip3 install virtualenv

As you create each Python project, you will also want to create an associated virtual environment in which you can install packages.

## Testing It Out

Now we can test our environment. Restart Atom. Then create a new file and save it as `test.py`. Or *anything*`.py` really, but make sure the filename has the `.py` extension so that Atom knows that it's Python source code.

Try testing some gibberish in the editor - you should see the linter issues appear at the bottom:

# Atom Python Packages

*These instructions are derived from [this blog post](http://www.marinamele.com/install-and-configure-atom-editor-for-python)*.

We're going to install some packages for Atom that makes writing Python much faster by providing real-time validation of your code. In general, these programs are called *linters*.

First we'll use the Atom Package Manager to install `linter`. Linter provides a single api that all the language-specific linters can use to interact with Atom.

	$ apm install linter

*If that didn't work and you see an errorÂ like `-bash: apm: command not found`, you need to install `apm` as a shell command accessible from the Terminal. In the menu, go to Atom --> Install Shell Commands and try again.*

Next we'll install the Python linting package, which is called `flake8`. There are two components - one which is a Python package, which takes the actual Python text and checks it with the compiler. We'll install that now.

	$ pip3 install flake8
	$ pip3 install flake8-docstrings

The other component is the Atom package that acts as the glue between `flake8` and `linter` to provide Atom with the real time validation.

	$ apm install linter-flake8

Finally, we have to make some changes to Atom. First we'll change the init script that runs every time Atom is opened.

In the menu, go to Atom --> Open Your Init Script.

Add the following line at the bottom:

	process.env.PATH = ['/usr/local/bin/', process.env.PATH].join(':')

Save that file.

Next we need to change a setting in the `linter-flake8` package. Go to the Atom Preferences page from the Atom menu. Click the packages menu item.

![Packages](packages.png)

Find the `linter-flake8` package and click the settings button.

*NOTE: If you don't see a settings button, try restarting Atom. Also ensure that you installed Atom into your Applications directory and that you're running that Atom.*

Find the executable path setting:

To figure out where the `flake8` executable is located in our filesystem, we can use the `which` command. Go to the terminal and type:

	$ which flake8

Take the result of that command, and paste it into the exectuable path setting in Atom.

In my case, `flake8` was here:

	/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/flake8
