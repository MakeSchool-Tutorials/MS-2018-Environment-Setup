People kept calling Einstein a genius. He got frustrated and said "Genius is focus". He meant that genius to him was just being able to stay focused. For our purposes, staying focused means not getting distracted. So let's look at some strategies to stay focused and avoid distractions.

# Manage your Notifications

Desktop Notifications are annoying and steal your time and productivityâ€”what will make you a successful developer. Let's turn them off.

> [action]
>
> 1. Head back over to system preferences, and click on "Notifications".
> 1. Select Mail, Messages, Discord, Slack, Calendar, and any other app that might throw a lot of notifications and customize their alert styles to your preference.

You will still check these apps, but you will check them on your time, not because they shoot a notification at you when you are trying to focus on something else.

# WakaTime

You are here to code, and what better service could you use than a "FitBit for Coding". So we've bought you a free license for some excellent software that will give you insights into how and when and how much you code.!

[WakaTime](https://www.wakatime.com) was invented by one of Captain Rainbow's friends Alan Hamlett. It gives you and your coach the ability to see exactly how much you are coding, in which languages, and on what projects.

# Clean Up Old Unreads

Sometimes you get a few hundred or thousand unread emails in the hole and it is impossible to mark them all as read. Take this time to start fresh and mark all your old emails as read.

# Setting Up Music

Music can help you focus, but it can also be a distraction if you are always fiddling with it.

> [action]
>
> Take a minute to reflect on if you like to listen to music when you code, and if music is helping or hurting your level of focus.

### Music Tips

1. Listen to music without lyrics
1. Setup radio stations or playlists that you like ahead of time so you can just hit play and not be interrupted for 2-3 hours.
1. Use earbuds or over-ear headphones that block out other sound and show people that you are busy working and not to distract you.
